"Psyflood is a Python script that utilizes multiple processes to simultaneously attack a target system via a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. It uses the PscyhoPy library to create multiple processes to simultaneously create requests, essentially overloading the target's network with too many requests to handle. The script is designed to be easy to use and requires minimal input from the user, while providing a powerful and effective means of attack. So, let the flooding begin, and have fun!"
